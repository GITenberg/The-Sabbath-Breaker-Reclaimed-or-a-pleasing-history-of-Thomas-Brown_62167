<h2><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>HISTORY
<span class="GutSmall">OF</span> THOMAS BROWN.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">On</span> a fine Sabbath
morn, in the sweet month of May,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the hawthorn in blossom was seen;<br />
When perfumes filled the air, and all nature look&rsquo;d gay,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fields wore a livery of green:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thomas said to his wife, the morning is
fine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then let us walk out at our leisure;<br />
I have worked all the week, recreation we&rsquo;ll seek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fields will afford us much pleasure.</p>
<p class="poetry">Said his wife, &ldquo;all our clothes are both
dirty and torn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which will set decent people a talking;<br />
I shall feel much ashamed, and we both shall be blamed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By those we may meet as we&rsquo;re
walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The birds and the cattle, says Thomas, you
know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dress all days alike, void of care;<br />
Let us follow their plan, be as blithe as we can,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And <i>not</i> make things worse than they are.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t well be worse, for at
home or abroad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve nothing for dinner to-day;<br />
Our money&rsquo;s all gone, and credit we&rsquo;ve none,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So e&rsquo;en let us do as you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>They lock&rsquo;d up their house, and their children they
took,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unhappy at home or abroad;<br />
And away they all went, (&rsquo;twas a Sabbath mispent)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the chance of the fields or the road.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not long they had walked, when a neighbour they
met,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they tried his attention to shun;<br />
But he saw them so plain, to escape him was vain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus to discourse he begun:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Where have you been wandering about,
Thomas Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In your jacket so out of repair?&rdquo;<br />
A rambling I&rsquo;ve been, o&rsquo;er the meadows so green,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I work in the jacket I wear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;But do you not hear the church bell,
Thomas Brown?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh! why not the Sabbath regard!&rdquo;<br />
We a living must seek and we work all the week:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If we can&rsquo;t enjoy Sunday &rsquo;tis hard!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;But what could your work do for you,
Thomas Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were you not by your Maker befriended?&rdquo;<br />
Why that I don&rsquo;t know,&mdash;if to church we should go,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps matters would not be much mended.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What I say I intend for your good,
Thomas Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And your friend am desirous to be!&rdquo;<br />
Why that I suppose, or your time you&rsquo;d not lose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To discourse with a poor man like me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;This world is fast hasting away, Thomas Brown,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And short are the pleasures of man;&rdquo;<br />
Then there&rsquo;s no time to spare, let us drive away care,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And merrily live while we can.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;But what when this world you shall
leave, Thomas Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If your soul in dread torments should lie?&rdquo;<br
/>
Why that to be sure, would be hard to endure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But I cannot well help it, not I.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Yet the wretch under sentence of death,
Thomas Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would be glad for a pardon to run!&rdquo;<br />
Why, yes, so would I, if condemned to die;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But I know not what harm I have done.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The Bible will tell you your sins,
Thomas Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a Saviour will bring to your view:&rdquo;<br />
The learn&rsquo;d there may look, but I can&rsquo;t read the
book;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It may, or it may not be true.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Hie away to the church on the hill,
Thomas Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For if you can&rsquo;t read you can hear:&rdquo;<br
/>
The man with the band I shall not understand;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rich and the wise may go there.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The Gospel is preach&rsquo;d to the
poor, Thomas Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And would lighten your cares, do not doubt
it.&rdquo;<br />
You speak like a friend, but I do not intend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To trouble myself much about it.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>&ldquo;Could I tell you where treasure is hid, Thomas
Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You would spare neither labour nor pains.&rdquo;<br
/>
In that you are right; I would dig day and night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And merrily live on my gains.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;But what, should you gain the whole
world, Thomas Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lose your own soul, at the last?&rdquo;<br />
Why, my courage would cool; I should then prove a fool,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sorely repent of the past.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Seek in time for the kingdom of God,
Thomas Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And your pleasures will never decay.&rdquo;<br />
I feel half inclined to become of your mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I hope I shall do as you say.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;May the God of all peace give you grace,
Thomas Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In his fear and his favour to dwell;&rdquo;<br />
Your wish is most kind, I shall bear it in mind;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so for the present farewell.</p>
<h3>SECOND DIALOGUE.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SUNDAY MORNING.</span></h3>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Whither go you, so clean and well clad,
Thomas Brown?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For your jacket&rsquo;s a new one, I see.&rdquo;<br
/>
Sir, I go, with good will, to the church on the hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To thank God for his goodness to me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;To hear this, it does my heart good, Thomas
Brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I hope you&rsquo;ll continue to go.&rdquo;<br />
This, Sir, I intend; and as you are my friend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be pleased something further to
know.</p>
<p class="poetry">When, after our converse, I first went to
church,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember&rsquo;d the days of my folly,<br />
When I heard them at prayer, I thought God must be there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the place appear&rsquo;d solemn and holy.</p>
<p class="poetry">The prayers being over, then sweetly they
sung;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt glad that I had gone in;<br />
The sermon came next, and this was the text,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That death is the wages of sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The minister told us, that all wicked men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who the paths of iniquity trod,<br />
Would be turn&rsquo;d into hell, in darkness to dwell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all people forgetting their God.</p>
<p class="poetry">I listen&rsquo;d awhile, and felt struck with
fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A cloud seem&rsquo;d to hang over my head,<br />
A tear stood in my eye, and I could not tell why,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But my heart was as heavy as lead.</p>
<p class="poetry">On the morrow I spake of what I had heard,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; While my shopmates were laughing and lazy,<br />
And I should have said more, but they set up a roar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cried out, &ldquo;Tom Brown is gone
crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Then I laugh&rsquo;d and I sung with the best of them
all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tried to forget what had pass&rsquo;d;<br />
But I thought in my mind, shall I good in this find,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If I lose my own soul at the last?</p>
<p class="poetry">So again the next Sunday I went to the
church,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though my shopmates all join&rsquo;d to upbraid;<br
/>
For I thought why should I, fear a man that will die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More than Him by whom all things were made?</p>
<p class="poetry">The minister spake so loud and so plain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the poorest might well understand;<br />
&ldquo;Repent ye,&rdquo; said he, and seem&rsquo;d pointing at
me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;For the kingdom of God is at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I felt myself vile as he told me my sins;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he knew them I could not well doubt it;<br />
For it came in my head, what to you I had said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I thought you had told all about it.</p>
<p class="poetry">When I heard what my Saviour had
suffer&rsquo;d, I wept;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How he groan&rsquo;d and he died on the tree;<br />
But O, the blest hour! for the word came with power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I knew that he suffer&rsquo;d for me.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus God has dealt with me, and thus has been
pleased<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His great goodness and grace to impart;<br />
It was terror and dread, that first bowed down my head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But &rsquo;twas mercy that melted my heart.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Every week from my wages a sixpence I spare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A Bible to buy, for I need it;<br />
And when time I can spare, to a friend I repair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who has promised to teach me to read it.</p>
<p class="poetry">And you, Sir, have been a most kind friend to
me:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This I own, though I cannot repay;<br />
But yet there is one, who this kindness will own<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last and the great judgment day.</p>
<p class="poetry">For myself, as becomes a poor, weak, sinful
man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will pray for support from on high;<br />
To walk in God&rsquo;s ways, my Saviour to praise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to trust in his grace till I die.</p>
<p class="poetry">And though poor, and unwise in the ways of the
world,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe in the truth of God&rsquo;s word,<br />
That <i>true riches</i> are they, which will not pass away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And <i>true wisdom</i>, the fear of the Lord.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
